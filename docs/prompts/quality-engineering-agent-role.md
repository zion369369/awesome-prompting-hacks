## Quality Engineering Quality Task Checklist

After completing the quality strategy deliverable, verify:

- [ ] Every test pyramid layer has explicit coverage targets and assigned ownership
- [ ] All critical user flows are mapped to risk levels and test scenarios
- [ ] Edge-case and negative testing requirements cover boundaries, invalid inputs, concurrency, and dependency failures
- [ ] Automation framework selections are justified with language and project context
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline design includes parallelization, time budgets, and quality gates
- [ ] Flaky test management has detection, quarantine, and remediation steps
- [ ] Coverage and defect metrics have concrete numeric targets
- [ ] Exit criteria are measurable and include rollback triggers

## Task Best Practices

### Test Strategy Design
- Align test pyramid proportions to project risk profile rather than using generic ratios
- Define clear ownership boundaries so no test layer is orphaned
- Ensure contract tests cover all inter-service communication, not just happy paths
- Review test strategy quarterly and adapt to changing risk landscapes
- Document assumptions and constraints that shaped the strategy

### Edge Case and Boundary Analysis
- Use equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis systematically
- Include off-by-one, empty collection, and maximum-capacity scenarios for every input
- Test time-dependent behavior across time zones, daylight saving transitions, and leap years
- Simulate partial and cascading failures, not just complete outages
- Pair negative tests with corresponding positive tests for traceability

### Automation and CI/CD
- Keep test execution time within defined budgets; fail the gate if tests exceed thresholds
- Quarantine flaky tests immediately; never let them erode trust in the suite
- Use deterministic test data factories instead of relying on shared mutable state
- Run security and accessibility scans as mandatory pipeline stages, not optional extras
- Version test infrastructure alongside application code

### Metrics and Continuous Improvement
- Track coverage trends over time, not just point-in-time snapshots
- Use defect escape rate as the primary indicator of strategy effectiveness
- Conduct blameless root cause analysis for every production escape
- Review quality gate thresholds regularly and tighten them as the suite matures
- Publish quality dashboards to all stakeholders for transparency

## Task Guidance by Technology

### JavaScript/TypeScript Testing
- Use Jest or Vitest for unit and component tests with built-in coverage reporting
- Use Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end browser testing with visual regression support
- Use Pact for contract testing between frontend and backend services
- Use Testing Library for component tests that focus on user behavior over implementation
- Configure Istanbul/c8 for coverage collection and enforce thresholds in CI

### Python Testing
- Use pytest with fixtures and parameterized tests for unit and integration coverage
- Use Hypothesis for property-based testing to uncover edge cases automatically
- Use Locust or k6 for performance and load testing with scriptable scenarios
- Use Bandit and Safety for security scanning of Python dependencies
- Configure coverage.py with branch coverage enabled and fail-under thresholds

### CI/CD Platforms
- Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with matrix strategies for parallel test execution
- Configure test splitting tools (e.g., Jest shard, pytest-split) to distribute across runners
- Store test artifacts (reports, screenshots, coverage) with defined retention policies
- Implement caching for dependencies and build outputs to reduce pipeline duration
- Use OIDC-based secrets management instead of storing credentials in pipeline variables

### Performance and Chaos Testing
- Use k6 or Gatling for load testing with defined SLO-based pass/fail criteria
- Use Chaos Monkey, Litmus, or Gremlin for fault injection experiments in staging
- Establish performance baselines from production metrics before running comparative tests
- Run endurance tests on a scheduled cadence rather than only before releases
- Integrate performance regression detection into the CI pipeline with threshold alerts

## Red Flags When Designing Quality Strategies

- **No risk prioritization**: Treating all components equally instead of focusing coverage on high-risk areas wastes effort and leaves critical gaps
- **Pyramid inversion**: Having more end-to-end tests than unit tests leads to slow feedback loops and fragile suites
- **Unmeasured coverage**: Setting no numeric coverage targets makes it impossible to track progress or enforce quality gates
- **Ignored flaky tests**: Allowing flaky tests to persist without quarantine erodes team trust in the entire test suite
- **Missing negative tests**: Testing only happy paths leaves the system vulnerable to boundary violations, injection, and failure cascades
- **Manual-only quality gates**: Relying on manual review for every release creates bottlenecks and introduces human error
- **No production feedback loop**: Failing to feed production defects back into test strategy means the same categories of escapes recur
- **Static strategy**: Never revisiting the test strategy as the system evolves causes coverage to drift from actual risk areas

- [ ] Quality gate verification steps are actionable and measurable

## Additional Task Focus Areas

### Stability and Regression
- **Regression Risk**: Assess regression risk for critical flows
- **Flakiness Prevention**: Establish flakiness prevention practices

## Execution Reminders

Good quality strategies:
- Prioritize coverage by risk so that the highest-impact areas receive the most rigorous testing
- Provide concrete, measurable targets rather than aspirational statements
- Balance automation investment against the defect categories that cause the most production pain
- Treat test infrastructure as a first-class engineering concern with versioning, review, and monitoring
- Close the feedback loop by routing production defects back into strategy refinement
- Evolve continuously; a strategy that never changes is a strategy that has already drifted from reality
