## **📥 1. Data Extraction Rules**

### **1.1 Extract Profile Data from JSON**
For each JSON file (e.g., `profile1.json`), extract at minimum:

- **First name** → `data.firstname`  
- **Last name** → `data.lastname`  
- **Professional experiences** → `data.experiences`  
- **Skills** → `data.skills`  
- **Current role** → `data.experiences[0]`  
- **Headline / summary** (if available)

> **Note:** Adapt the extraction logic to match the exact structure of your JSON/data model.

---

### **1.2 Extract Opportunity Data from PDF**

#### **HR – Job Offer PDF**
Extract:
- Company name  
- Job title  
- Required skills  
- Responsibilities  
- Location  
- Tech stack (if applicable)  
- Any additional context that helps match the candidate

#### **Sales – Service / Technical Offer PDF**
Extract:
- Company name  
- Description of the service  
- Pain points addressed  
- Value proposition  
- Technical scope  
- Pricing model (if present)  
- Call‑to‑action or next steps

---

## **🧠 2. Message Generation Logic**

### **2.1 One Message per Profile**
For each JSON file, generate a **separate, standalone message** with a clear title such as:

- **Candidate Outreach – ${firstname} ${lastname}**  
- **Sales Prospect Outreach – ${firstname} ${lastname}**

---

### **2.2 Universal Message Structure**

Each message must follow this structure:

---

### **1. Personalized Introduction**
Use the candidate/prospect’s full name.

**Example:**  
“Hello {data.firstname} {data.lastname},”

---

### **2. Highlight Relevant Experience**
Identify the most relevant experience based on the PDF content.

Include:
- Job title  
- Company  
- One key skill  

**Example:**  
“Your recent role as {data.experiences[0].title} at {data.experiences[0].subtitle.split('.')[0].trim()} particularly stood out, especially your expertise in {data.skills[0].title}.”

---

### **3. Present the Opportunity (HR or Sales)**

#### **HR Version (Candidate)**  
Describe:
- The company  
- The role  
- Why the candidate is a strong match  
- Required skills aligned with their background  
- Any relevant mission, culture, or tech stack elements  

#### **Sales Version (Prospect)**  
Describe:
- The service or technical offer  
- The prospect’s potential needs (inferred from their experience)  
- How your solution addresses their challenges  
- A concise value proposition  
- Why the timing may be relevant  

---

### **4. Call to Action**
Encourage a next step.

Examples:
- “I’d be happy to discuss this opportunity with you.”  
- “Feel free to book a slot on my Calendly.”  
- “Let’s explore how this solution could support your team.”

---

### **5. Closing & Contact Information**
End with:
- Appreciation  
- Contact details  
- Calendly link (if provided)

---
