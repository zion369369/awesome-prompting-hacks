## 💡 The Prompt Engineering Code

Copy and paste this structured prompt into your AI console:

```text
ROLE: Senior Node.js Automation Engineer

GOAL:
Build a REAL, production-ready Account Registration & Reporting Automation System using Node.js.
This system MUST perform real browser automation and real network operations.
NO simulation, NO mock data, NO placeholders, NO pseudo-code.

SIMULATION POLICY:
NEVER simulate anything.
NEVER generate fake outputs.
NEVER use dummy services.
All logic must be executable and functional.

TECH STACK:
- Node.js (ES2022+)
- Playwright (preferred) OR puppeteer-extra + stealth plugin
- Native fs module
- readline OR inquirer
- axios (for API & Telegram)
- Express (for dashboard API)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

1) INPUT SYSTEM
- Asynchronously read emails from "gmailer.txt"
- Each line = one email
- Prompt user for:
  • username prefix
  • password
  • headless mode (true/false)
- Must not block event loop

2) BROWSER AUTOMATION
For EACH email:

- Launch browser with optional headless mode
- Use random User-Agent from internal list
- Apply random delays between actions
- Open NEW browserContext per attempt
- Clear cookies automatically
- Handle navigation errors gracefully

3) FREE PROXY SUPPORT (NO PAID SERVICES)
- Use ONLY free public HTTP/HTTPS proxies
- Load proxies from proxies.txt
- Rotate proxy per account
- If proxy fails → retry with next proxy
- System must still work without proxy

4) BOT AVOIDANCE / BYPASS
- Random viewport size
- Random typing speed
- Random mouse movements (if supported)
- navigator.webdriver masking
- Acceptable stealth techniques only
- NO illegal bypass methods

5) ACCOUNT CREATION FLOW
System must be modular so target site can be configured later.

Expected steps:

- Navigate to registration page
- Fill email, username, password
- Submit form
- Detect success or failure
- Extract any confirmation data if available

6) FILE OUTPUT SYSTEM

On SUCCESS:

Append to:
outputs/basarili_hesaplar.txt
FORMAT:
email:username:password

Append username only:
outputs/kullanici_adlari.txt

Append password only:
outputs/sifreler.txt

On FAILURE:

Append to:
logs/error_log.txt

FORMAT:
${timestamp} Email: X | Error: MESSAGE

7) TELEGRAM NOTIFICATION

Optional but implemented:

If TELEGRAM_TOKEN and CHAT_ID are set:

Send message:

"New Account Created:
Email: X
User: Y
Time: Z"

8) REAL-TIME DASHBOARD API

Create Express server on port 3000.

Endpoints:

GET /stats
Return JSON:

{
  total,
  success,
  failed,
  running,
  elapsedSeconds
}

GET /logs
Return last 100 log lines

Dashboard must update in real time.

9) FINAL CONSOLE REPORT

After all emails processed:

Display console.table:

- Total Attempts
- Successful
- Failed
- Success Rate %
- Total Duration (seconds & minutes)

10) ERROR HANDLING

- Every account attempt wrapped in try/catch
- Failure must NOT crash system
- Continue processing remaining emails

11) CODE QUALITY

- Fully async/await
- Modular architecture
- No global blocking
- Clean separation of concerns

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

/project-root
  main.js
  gmailer.txt
  proxies.txt
  /outputs
  /logs
  /dashboard

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

Produce:

1) Complete runnable Node.js code
2) package.json
3) Clear instructions to run
4) No Docker
5) No paid tools
6) No simulation
7) No incomplete sections

IMPORTANT:

If any requirement cannot be implemented,
provide the closest REAL functional alternative.

Do NOT ask questions.
Do NOT generate explanations only.
Generate FULL WORKING CODE.
```
