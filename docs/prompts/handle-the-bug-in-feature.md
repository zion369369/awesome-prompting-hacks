# Handle the bug in feature

## Prompt Template
```text
Act as a senior Flutter engineer + GIS/map system expert (ArcGIS-like SDK).

## Context
I am a non-technical developer using AI to build a map-based app (Flutter + Map SDK).

This feature involves:
- Map rendering
- Layer loading
- Dynamic property application (styling / behavior)

There is a bug, and previous AI fixes made the system more complex.

I do NOT understand:
- How map SDK handles layers internally
- When properties are applied (before/after render)
- Full data flow across UI → logic → SDK

You MUST first explain system clearly before fixing.

---

## Inputs

Feature:
${feature_description}

Expected Behavior:
${expected_behavior}

Actual Issue:
${actual_issue}

Code:
${code_snippet}

---

## Output Format (STRICT)

### 1. Map System Flow (Visual + Layer-Specific)

#### A. Flow Diagram
Provide a real flow diagram based on the given feature and code, showing:
- User action
- UI layer
- Controller/state handling
- Layer creation
- SDK interaction
- Property application
- Rendering
- UI update

---

#### B. Explain Each Stage
Explain clearly:
- What happens at each step
- What data is passed between layers
- What the SDK is likely doing internally

---

#### C. Critical Timing Points (IMPORTANT)
Identify:
- When the layer is created
- When data is loaded from source
- When properties SHOULD be applied relative to SDK lifecycle

---

### 2. Expected Behavior (Map-Specific)
Define expected behavior based on inputs:
- Successful layer load
- Correct property application
- Failure scenarios (invalid input, missing data, SDK failure)

If unclear, ask up to 3 specific questions and STOP.

---

### 3. Current Behavior
Explain what is actually happening using:
- The provided issue description
- The given code

---

### 4. Mismatch (Critical)
Identify exactly:
- Where expected behavior differs from actual behavior
- Which step in the flow is failing

---

### 5. Root Cause (Precise)
Identify the exact reason for the bug:
- Timing issue
- Incorrect layer reference
- State not updating
- Async handling issue

Point to specific function, block, or lifecycle stage in the code.

If unsure, clearly state assumptions.

---

### 6. Minimal Fix (STRICT)
- Provide the smallest possible change
- Do NOT rewrite the system
- Provide ONLY the modified code snippet

Focus on:
- Fixing timing
- Correcting data flow
- Fixing state updates

---

### 7. Why Fix Works
Explain how the fix resolves the issue:
- Link it to the system flow
- Link it to SDK behavior
- Link it to timing/lifecycle

---

### 8. Map-Specific Risks (IMPORTANT)
Analyze:
- Impact on other layers
- Performance implications
- Possible re-render issues

---

### 9. Prevention (Map Architecture)
Suggest improvements:
- Better layer lifecycle handling
- Proper placement of property logic:
  - Config layer
  - Renderer
  - Controller

---

## Constraints
- Do NOT assume SDK behavior without stating it
- Do NOT move logic randomly
- Do NOT add conditions blindly
- Focus on timing and data flow

---

## Fallback Rule
If inputs are insufficient:
- Ask up to 3 specific questions
- STOP and wait for clarification

---

## Self-Check
Before answering:
- Did I map the bug to a specific flow step?
- Did I identify a timing issue if present?
- Is the fix minimal and scoped?
- Did I avoid over-engineering?
```
