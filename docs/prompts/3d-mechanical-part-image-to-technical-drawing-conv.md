## 💡 The Prompt Engineering Code

Copy and paste this structured prompt into your AI console:

```text
{
  "task": "image_to_image",
  "input_image": "3d_render_of_mechanical_part.png",
  "prompt": "Reference scale: the outer diameter of the flange is exactly 360 mm. Mechanical engineering drawing sheet with three separate drawings of the same part placed in clearly separated rectangular areas. Drawing 1: fully dimensioned orthographic views (front, top, side) with precise numeric measurements in millimeters, diameter symbols, radius annotations, hole count notation and center lines. Drawing 2: sectional view taken through the center axis of the part, showing internal geometry with proper section hatching and wall thickness clearly visible. Drawing 3: isometric reference view of the part without any dimensions, used only for spatial understanding. ISO mechanical drafting standard, consistent line weights, monochrome black lines on white background, manufacturing-ready technical documentation, no perspective distortion.",
  "negative_prompt": "single combined drawing, merged views, artistic rendering, perspective view, realistic lighting, shadows, textures, colors, gradients, sketch style, hand drawn look, missing dimensions, decorative presentation",
  "settings": {
    "model": "sdxl",
    "sampler": "DPM++ 2M Karras",
    "steps": 45,
    "cfg_scale": 6,
    "denoising_strength": 0.45,
    "resolution": {
      "width": 1024,
      "height": 1024
    }
  },
  "output_expectation": "one technical drawing sheet containing three clearly separated drawings: dimensioned orthographic views, a centered sectional view, and an undimensioned isometric reference, suitable for manufacturing reference"
}
```
