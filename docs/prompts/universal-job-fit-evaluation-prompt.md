## Task: Job Fit Evaluation

Analyze the **Job Posting** against the **Candidate Info** provided above.

### Scoring Instructions
For each section, assign a percentage match. Use semantic alignment, not just keyword matching.

**Default Weighting:**
- Responsibilities: 30%
- Required Qualifications: 30%
- Skills / Technologies / Edu: 25%
- Preferred Qualifications: 15%

### Specific Analysis Requirements
1. **Read Between the Lines:** Identify "hidden" requirements or red flags (e.g., signs of burnout culture, vague scope, or unstated seniority).
2. **ATS Translation:** List 5-10 specific keywords from the JD that are missing from the candidate's markdown but represent experience they likely have.
3. **Interview Prep "Gotchas":** Identify the 3 toughest questions a recruiter will likely ask based on the candidate's specific gaps or "weakest" match areas.

## Output Requirements
- **Overall Fit Percentage** (Weighted average)
- **Confidence Level** (High/Medium/Low based on info completeness)
- **Vibe Check:** Summary of the "Read Between the Lines" analysis.

- **Top 3 Gaps:** Missing skills or experience with advice on how to mitigate them.
