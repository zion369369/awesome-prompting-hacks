## YOUR TASK

My bankroll is: ${bankroll:$18 SC}
My total wagering target is: ${wagering_target:$100 SC}
My risk level is: ${risk_level:Medium}
My maximum acceptable loss for this wagering session is: ${acceptable_loss:10% of bankroll}
My desired session length is: ${session_length:30 minutes}
Number of strategies to generate: ${num_strategies:5}

Using the parameters above, generate exactly ${num_strategies:5} complete, distinct autobet strategies tailored for wagering completion rather than profit chasing.

Each strategy MUST use a DIFFERENT wagering style from this list (no duplicates):
- Flat Micro Grinder
- High Win-Chance Recovery Ladder
- Soft Loss Chaser
- Win Chance Shield
- Time-Boxed Volume Builder
- Direction Switch Grinder
- Ultra-Low Variance Churn
- Capped Mini-Progression
- Streak Brake System
- Hybrid Safety Ladder

Spread them from safest to most aggressive within the selected risk level.

### IMPORTANT WAGERING PRINCIPLES
- Prioritize lower variance and bankroll longevity over big profit spikes.
- Favor high win-chance setups unless a different setup is clearly justified.
- Avoid reckless Martingale trees unless tightly capped and mathematically survivable for the stated bankroll.
- Every recommendation must account for the 1% house edge.
- Wagering progress is measured by total amount bet, NOT by profit.
- A strategy can be slightly losing in expectation and still be useful if it survives longer and clears more wagering.
- Optimize for expected wagering completed before stop-loss is hit.
- Use real Stake.us Advanced Autobet conditions only.
- Direction changes (Over/Under) do NOT change EV; they are only for workflow, rhythm, and anti-tilt structure.

## WAGERING COMPARISON TABLE
| Strategy | Style | Win Chance | Base Bet | Max Bet Cap | Volatility Score (1-10) | Expected Wagering Before Stop | Best Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## BEST WAGERING PICK
Choose the single best strategy for my exact bankroll, risk level, and wagering target, and explain why it is superior for completion efficiency rather than profit.

## PRO TIPS FOR WAGERING ON STAKE.US DICE
1. Why high win-chance setups usually work best for rollover even though the house edge is unchanged
2. How to use Set Win Chance on losing streaks to reduce variance without pretending it beats the game
3. How to calculate a sane Max Bet Cap for a wagering-focused session
4. Why Stop-on-Loss matters more than Stop-on-Profit for playthrough
5. Why Roll Over / Roll Under is mathematically irrelevant but still useful psychologically
6. How to pace sessions to reduce tilt during wagering
7. How much of the wagering target is realistically completable with the stated bankroll before expected ruin risk rises too far

## CRITICAL RULES FOR YOUR OUTPUT
- Every strategy must be genuinely different.
- ALL conditions must be real, working parameters available in Stake.us Advanced Autobet.
- Account for the 1% house edge in ALL EV and wagering-efficiency calculations.
- Base bet must not exceed 1% of bankroll for Low risk, 2% for Medium risk, 3% for High risk unless exceptionally justified.
- Wagering-focused strategies should generally use smaller base bets than profit-focused strategies.
- Dollar amounts are in Stake Cash (SC); scale proportionally for Gold Coins (GC).
- Stake.us is a sweepstakes/social casino — always remind the user to play responsibly within their means.
- Never frame any strategy as guaranteed, safe, or profitable long term.
- Never suggest wagering more than the user can afford to lose.
