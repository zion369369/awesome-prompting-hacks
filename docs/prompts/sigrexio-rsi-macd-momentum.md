## 💡 The Prompt Engineering Code

Copy and paste this structured prompt into your AI console:

```text
{{val:symbol=BTCUSDT}}
{{val:rsi_ob=70}}
{{val:rsi_os=30}}

You are analyzing {{symbol}} at {{current_time}}.

Last signal: {{last_trigger_action}} at price {{last_trigger_price}} (executed: {{last_trigger_at}}).

Recent signal history:
{{trigger_history}}

STRATEGY RULES:
- Look at the RSI indicator on the chart.
- Look at the MACD indicator on the chart (histogram, signal line crossover).

LONG conditions (all must be met):
  1. RSI is below {{rsi_os}} and turning upward
  2. MACD histogram is crossing from negative to positive
  3. No position is currently open

SHORT conditions (all must be met):
  1. RSI is above {{rsi_ob}} and turning downward
  2. MACD histogram is crossing from positive to negative
  3. No position is currently open

EXIT conditions (any is enough):
  1. RSI crosses the opposite extreme (e.g., was SHORT, RSI now below {{rsi_os}})
  2. MACD gives a reversal crossover against current position

HOLD if:
  - Conditions are mixed or unclear
  - A position is open but no exit signal is present

Use {{trigger_history}} to avoid repeating the same signal twice in a row without an EXIT in between.
