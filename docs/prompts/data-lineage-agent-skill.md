# Data Lineage Agent Skill

## Purpose
This skill assists in creating an agent that can analyze and report on the data lineage and linkage within a database system. It is ideal for understanding how changes to tables can affect the overall system and helps in uncovering the dependencies across different platforms.

## Steps to Create the Agent
1. **Access the Repository:**
   - Link to the GitHub repository: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/optuminsight-payer/COB-PARS_DB_SCRIPTS)
   - Clone the repository to access all database scripts and stored procedures.

2. **Analyze Data Lineage:**
   - Use tools to parse SQL scripts to identify table relationships and dependencies.
   - Map out the data flow from source tables to final tables.

3. **Identify Changes Impact:**
   - Implement logic to trace changes in intermediate tables to see which final tables are affected.
   - Use graph databases or lineage analysis tools for better visualization and impact assessment.

4. **Host the Agent:**
   - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) to deploy the agent for continuous analysis and reporting.

## Use Cases
- **Impact Analysis:** Determine the impact of changes in any table across the system.
- **Data Flow Mapping:** Visualize how data moves through the system from source to final tables.
- **Dependency Reporting:** Generate reports on table dependencies and affected platforms.

## Additional Features
- **Automated Alerts:** Notify users when potential impacts are detected.
- **Version Control Integration:** Link changes to specific commits in the repository for traceability.

## Example Variables
- `${repositoryUrl}`: The URL of the GitHub repository.
- `${platforms}`: List of platforms involved in the data flow.

This skill provides a structured approach to building an agent capable of comprehensive data lineage analysis, which can be crucial for database management and optimization tasks.
