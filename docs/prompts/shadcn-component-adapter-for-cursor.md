# shadcn Component Visual Adapter

## 🎯 Objective
Refactor the existing `${component_name}` component located at `${component_file_path}` to match the **visual design, structure, and behavior** of the reference component available at:

> ${install_command:bunx --bun shadcn@latest add accordion}
${reference_url:}   ← optional; leave blank if no docs page exists

Do NOT replace business logic, existing props interface, or data-fetching patterns. Preserve them.
Adapt only the **visual layer**: markup structure, class names, animations, and accessibility attributes.

---

## 📋 Step 1 — Analyze the Existing Component

Before writing any code:

1. Read the full source of `${component_file_path}`.
2. Map out:
   - All **props and their types** (TypeScript interfaces or PropTypes).
   - Internal **state variables** (`useState`, `useReducer`, Zustand slices, etc.).
   - **Context providers or custom hooks** consumed.
   - **Child components** rendered and where they live.
   - **Event handlers** and callbacks exposed to the parent.
3. List every **import** — flag any that will conflict with or can be replaced by the shadcn primitive.

Output a brief audit table before touching any code:

| Item | Current value | Action |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Props | ... | keep / rename / remove |
| State | ... | keep / migrate |
| Context/Hooks | ... | keep / replace |
| Sub-components | ... | keep / replace |
| Dependencies | ... | keep / install / remove |

---

## 📦 Step 2 — Dependency Resolution

Run the install command directly:

${install_command}

After the command completes, the generated files will appear in
${components_dir:components/ui}/. Proceed to Step 3 using those files.

---

## 🔬 Step 3 — Review Reference Component

IF ${reference_url} is provided → fetch it and extract the visual spec as before.

IF ${reference_url} is blank → read the files downloaded by the CLI command
in Step 2 and extract the same information from the source code directly:
  - cva variant schema
  - data-state / data-disabled attributes
  - animation/transition classes
  - ARIA roles and props
  - cn() usage patterns

---

## 🛠 Step 4 — Refactor the Component

Apply the visual structure from Step 3 to the existing component from Step 1.

### Rules:
- ✅ Keep all **existing prop names and types** unless a direct shadcn equivalent exists.
- ✅ Keep all **data-fetching, business logic, and callbacks**.
- ✅ Wrap Radix primitives using **`forwardRef`** and spread `...props` to preserve flexibility.
- ✅ Use `cn()` for all className merging — never string concatenation.
- ✅ Export named compound sub-components if the reference component uses them (e.g., `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, `AccordionContent`).
- ❌ Do NOT import the generated shadcn file and re-export it — build the primitive inline in the refactored file to keep the logic co-located.
- ❌ Do NOT add Tailwind classes not present in the reference component without explicit instruction.

### Responsive behavior (`${responsive_breakpoints:sm md lg}`):
Apply mobile-first responsive classes. Confirm current breakpoints in `tailwind.config.ts` match the project's convention. If the reference uses container queries, install `@tailwindcss/container-queries`.

---

## 🧩 Step 5 — Context Providers and Hooks

If the reference component requires a context provider (e.g., `ToastProvider`, `TooltipProvider`):

1. Check if it is already mounted in `${provider_file:app/layout.tsx}` or `${provider_file:app/providers.tsx}`.
2. If not, add it to the appropriate layout file. Provide the exact diff.
3. If a custom hook is required (e.g., `useToast`, `useDialog`), place it in `${hooks_dir:hooks/}` and import it from there.

---

## ❓ Step 6 — Clarifying Questions (ask before generating if unknown)

If any of the following are not determinable from the existing code, **ask before writing**:

1. **Data/props**: What shape of data will be passed? (Provide a sample object if helpful.)
2. **State management**: Is component state local, or managed externally (Zustand, Redux, React Query)?
3. **Assets**: Are there required images, logos, or custom icons not covered by lucide-react?
4. **Responsive**: What is the expected layout at `${responsive_breakpoints:sm md lg}` breakpoints?
5. **Placement**: Where in the app routing/layout tree will this component live? (Important for context provider placement.)

---

## 📐 Step 7 — Output Format

Provide the result as:

1. **`${component_file_path}`** — full refactored component file.
2. **`${components_dir:components/ui}/${shadcn_component_slug}.tsx`** — shadcn primitive (only if needed and not generated by CLI).
3. **`lib/utils.ts`** — only if it needs to be created or updated.
4. **Layout/provider diff** — only if a provider needs to be added.
5. A short **migration notes** section listing:
   - Removed dependencies
   - Renamed props (if any)
   - Any manual steps required (e.g., adding CSS variables to `globals.css`)

---

## 🎨 Tailwind CSS Variables (shadcn design tokens)

Confirm that `globals.css` contains the required CSS custom properties. If the reference component uses tokens like `--radius`, `--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, `--ring`, append the missing variables. Use the shadcn default token set for `${color_theme:zinc}` unless the project already defines a custom theme.

---

## 🚫 Constraints

- Framework: **${framework:Next.js 14+ App Router}**
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS ${tailwind_version:3}** only — no inline styles, no CSS modules, no styled-components.
- TypeScript: **strict mode**. All new code must be fully typed.
- Do not upgrade or downgrade any existing dependency version unless there is a direct peer conflict.
```
