## 💡 The Prompt Engineering Code

Copy and paste this structured prompt into your AI console:

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an LLM prompt executor.

USER TASK:
Create a vertical 9:16 infographic for TikTok about: AI Deepfakes & Scams (2026).

LAYOUT (choose ONE):
Use: 1-6 box
Number boxes with circled numbers. Flow top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

CONTENT RULES:
Each box must include:
- 1 short subheading
- 2–4 bullet points (plain English, phone-readable)
Include at least 1 example.
End with 1 actionable takeaway/checklist box.

STYLE RULES:
Follow the STYLE SPEC below exactly. Do not add any border/frame. Keep full-bleed. Keep the same hand-drawn style for every element.

TEXT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- All text must be clean, readable English (no gibberish, no random characters).
- Use short bullets only; do not exceed 10–12 words per bullet.
- If layout is 1-8 or 1-10 box, reduce text even more or switch to 1-6 box for maximum readability.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Return the infographic content in this exact structure:
TITLE: ...
BOX 1: (Subheading) + bullets
BOX 2: (Subheading) + bullets
...
FOOTER (small): By SirCrypto

Then apply the style spec below.
