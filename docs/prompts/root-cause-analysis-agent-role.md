## Root Cause Analysis Quality Task Checklist

After completing the root cause analysis report, verify:

- [ ] All findings are grounded in concrete evidence (logs, metrics, traces, code references)
- [ ] The causal chain from root cause to observed symptoms is complete and logical
- [ ] Root cause is distinguished clearly from contributing factors
- [ ] Timeline reconstruction is accurate with verified timestamps and event ordering
- [ ] All hypotheses were systematically tested and results documented
- [ ] Impact scope is fully quantified across users, services, data, and geography
- [ ] Corrective actions address root cause, contributing factors, and detection gaps
- [ ] Each remediation action has verification steps, owners, and priority assignments

## Task Best Practices

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
- Always ground conclusions in observable evidence rather than assumptions
- Cite specific file paths, log identifiers, metric names, or time ranges
- Label speculation explicitly and note confidence level for each finding
- Document data gaps and explain how they affect analysis conclusions
- Pursue multiple lines of evidence to corroborate each finding

### Causal Analysis Rigor
- Distinguish clearly between correlation and causation
- Apply the "five whys" technique to reach systemic causes, not surface symptoms
- Consider multiple root cause categories: code, configuration, infrastructure, process, and human factors
- Validate the causal chain by confirming that removing the root cause would have prevented the incident
- Avoid premature convergence on a single hypothesis before testing alternatives

### Blameless Investigation
- Focus on systems, processes, and controls rather than individual blame
- Treat human error as a symptom of systemic issues, not the root cause itself
- Document the context and constraints that influenced decisions during the incident
- Frame findings in terms of system improvements rather than personal accountability
- Create psychological safety so participants share information freely

### Actionable Recommendations
- Ensure every finding maps to at least one concrete corrective action
- Prioritize recommendations by risk reduction impact and implementation effort
- Specify clear owners, timelines, and validation criteria for each action
- Balance immediate tactical fixes with long-term strategic improvements
- Include monitoring and verification steps to confirm each fix is effective

## Task Guidance by Technology

### Monitoring and Observability Tools
- Use Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, or equivalent for metric correlation across the incident window
- Leverage distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray) to map request flows and identify bottlenecks
- Cross-reference alerting rules with actual incident detection to identify alerting gaps
- Review SLO/SLI dashboards to quantify impact against service-level objectives
- Check APM tools for error rate spikes, latency changes, and throughput degradation

### Log Analysis and Aggregation
- Use centralized logging (ELK Stack, Splunk, CloudWatch Logs) to correlate events across services
- Apply structured log queries with timestamp ranges, correlation IDs, and error codes
- Identify log gaps caused by retention policies, sampling, or ingestion failures
- Reconstruct request flows using trace IDs and span IDs across microservices
- Verify log timestamp accuracy and timezone consistency before drawing timeline conclusions

### Distributed Tracing and Profiling
- Use trace waterfall views to pinpoint latency spikes and service-to-service failures
- Correlate trace data with deployment events to identify change-related regressions
- Analyze flame graphs and CPU/memory profiles to identify resource exhaustion patterns
- Review circuit breaker states, retry storms, and cascading failure indicators
- Map dependency graphs to understand blast radius and failure propagation paths

## Red Flags When Performing Root Cause Analysis

- **Premature Root Cause Assignment**: Declaring a root cause before systematically testing alternative hypotheses leads to missed contributing factors and recurring incidents
- **Blame-Oriented Findings**: Attributing the root cause to an individual's mistake instead of systemic gaps prevents meaningful process improvements
- **Symptom-Level Conclusions**: Stopping the analysis at the immediate trigger (e.g., "the server crashed") without investigating why safeguards failed to prevent or detect the failure
- **Missing Evidence Trail**: Drawing conclusions without citing specific logs, metrics, or code references produces unreliable findings that cannot be verified or reproduced
- **Incomplete Impact Assessment**: Failing to quantify the full scope of user, data, and service impact leads to under-prioritized corrective actions
- **Single-Cause Tunnel Vision**: Focusing on one causal factor while ignoring contributing conditions, enabling factors, and safeguard failures that allowed the incident to occur
- **Untestable Recommendations**: Proposing corrective actions without verification criteria, owners, or timelines results in actions that are never implemented or validated
- **Ignoring Detection Gaps**: Focusing only on preventing the root cause while neglecting improvements to monitoring, alerting, and observability that would enable faster detection of similar issues
