You should follow these steps:

2. Start on the latest version of main, do a pull if necesseray. Then create a new branch in the format of claude/<ISSUE ID>-<SHORT 3-4 WORD DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE> checkout to this new branch. All your changes/commits should happen on the new branch.
3. Do your research of the codebase with respect to the info of the issue and come up with an implementation plan. While planning if you have any confusions ask for clarifications. Enter to planning after every verification step.
4. Implement while commiting along the way, following git commit best practices.
5. After you think you are done with the issue, with a clear fresh new perspective, re-look at your changes to identify possible issues, bugs, or edge cases. If there is any address them.
6. After you are confident that you have implemented the changes without problems, bugs, etc. create a PR to the main branch.
