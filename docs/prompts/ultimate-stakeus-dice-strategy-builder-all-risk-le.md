## YOUR TASK

My bankroll is: **${bankroll:$50 SC}**
My risk level is: **${risk_level:Medium}**
My session profit goal is: **${profit_goal:10% of bankroll}**
My maximum acceptable loss for this session is: **${stop_loss:25% of bankroll}**
Number of strategies to generate: **${num_strategies:5}**

Using the parameters above, generate exactly **${num_strategies:5} complete, distinct autobet strategies** tailored to my bankroll and risk level. Each strategy MUST use a DIFFERENT approach from this list (no duplicates): Flat Bet, Classic Martingale, Soft Martingale (capped), Paroli / Reverse Martingale, D'Alembert, Contra-D'Alembert, Hybrid Streak (win chance shift + bet increase), High-Multiplier Hunter, Win Chance Ladder, Streak Switcher (switch Over/Under on streak). Spread across the spectrum from conservative to aggressive.

### Strategy Output Format (repeat for each strategy):

**Strategy #[N] — [Creative Name]**
**Style**: [Method name]
**Risk Profile**: [Low / Medium / High / Extreme]
**Best For**: [e.g., slow grind, bankroll preservation, quick spike, high variance hunting]

**Core Settings:**
- Win Chance: X%
- Direction: Roll Over [target] OR Roll Under [target]
- Multiplier: X.XXx
- Base Bet: $X.XX SC

| 3 | [e.g., Streak greater than 5 Losses] | [e.g., Set win chance to] | 75% |

**Stop Conditions:**
- Stop on Profit: $X.XX
- Stop on Loss: $X.XX

  Loss 1: $X | Loss 2: $X | Loss 3: $X | ... | Loss 10: $X | Total at risk: $X
- House edge drag per 1,000 bets at base bet: $X.XX expected loss
- Estimated rolls to hit profit goal (at 100 bets/min): ~X minutes

**Survival Probability Table:**
| Consecutive Losses | Probability |
|---|---|
| 3 in a row | X% |
| 5 in a row | X% |
| 7 in a row | X% |
| 10 in a row | X% |

**Bankroll Scaling:**
- Micro ($5–$25): Base bet $X.XX

### PRO TIPS FOR ${risk_level:Medium} RISK AT ${bankroll:$50 SC}
1. **Roll Over vs Roll Under**: When to switch directions mid-session and why direction is mathematically irrelevant but psychologically useful
2. **Dynamic Win Chance Shifting**: How to use "Set Win Chance" conditions to widen your winning range during a losing streak (e.g., loss streak 3 → set win chance 70%, loss streak 5 → set win chance 85%)
3. **Max Bet Cap Formula**: For a ${bankroll:$50 SC} bankroll at ${risk_level:Medium} risk, the Max Bet Cap should never exceed X% of bankroll — here's the exact math
4. **Stop-on-Profit Discipline**: Optimal profit targets per risk tier — Low: 5-8%, Medium: 10-15%, High: 20-30%, Extreme: 40%+ with tight stop-loss
5. **Seed Rotation**: Reset your Provably Fair client seed every 50-100 bets or after each profit target hit to avoid psychological tilt and maintain randomness perception
6. **Session Bankroll Isolation**: Never play with more than the session bankroll you set — vault the rest
7. **Worst-Case Scenario Planning**: At ${risk_level:Medium} risk with ${bankroll:$50 SC}, here is the maximum theoretical drawdown sequence and how to survive it

**CRITICAL RULES FOR YOUR OUTPUT:**
- Every strategy MUST be genuinely different — different win chance, different condition logic, different style
- ALL conditions must be real, working parameters available in Stake.us Advanced Autobet
- Account for the 1% house edge in ALL EV and expected loss calculations
- Base bet must not exceed 2% of bankroll for Low, 3% for Medium, 5% for High, 10% for Extreme risk
- Dollar amounts are in Stake Cash (SC) — scale proportionally for Gold Coins (GC)
- Stake.us is a sweepstakes/social casino — always remind the user to play responsibly within their means
